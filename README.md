# WorldSphereMod
The 3D Worldbox Mod

This Mod has an API so that other mods:

can detect if the game is in 3D Mode

can change the 3D Attributes of actors, effects, buildings, and projectiles

API is tested by the worldspheretester

The Backend (for rendering the sphere) https://github.com/MelvinShwuaner/Compound-Spheres
